Hello there.

This is my public GitHub repository. I am an academic librarian undertaking a master's degree, and I've been fortunate enough to become a part-time developer by profession. Currently, I'm employed at the University of Oslo with the institute of linguistics and Nordic studies. My name is anglicized as *Loki* and pronounced *"low key"*.

My interests include HTML, JavaScript, Python and cats. I don't participate in social media, so if you want to get in touch for whatever reason you'd have a better chance of getting a reply by chanting my name to the cruel, silent stars at night than contacting me on Facebook/LinkedIn. You could, alternatively, send an e-mail or open an issue.

Thanks.
Loki
