Hello there.

This is my public GitHub repository. I am an academic librarian pursuing a master's degree, and I've been fortunate enough to become a part-time developer by profession. Currently, I'm employed at the University of Oslo with the institute of linguistics and Nordic studies.

My interests include HTML, JavaScript, Python and cats. If you want to get in touch, you could send an e-mail or open an issue. Do not contact me on social media - I don't check.

Thanks.
Loki
