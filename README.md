Hello there.

This is my public GitHub repository. I am an academic librarian pursuing a master's degree, and I've been fortunate enough to become a full-time developer by profession.

My interests include HTML, JavaScript, Python and cats. If you want to get in touch, you could send an e-mail or open an issue.

Thanks.
Loki
